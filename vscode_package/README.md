# SIN README

This extension allows VSCode to be used as an IDE for the SIN programming language. Currently includes syntax highlighting.

## Features

Currently, the only supported feature is syntax highlighting. I intend not only to improve syntax highlighting in the future, but to add semantic highlighting as well.

## Requirements

There are currently no requirements for this package.

## Extension Settings

No settings are added with this extension for the time being.

## Known Issues

The syntax highlighting isn't particularly good. The feature set is also very limited.

## Release Notes

Bug fixes, update to add newer and future features of SIN.
