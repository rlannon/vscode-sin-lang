# vscode-sin-lang

A VSCode extension to allow development of the SIN Language within VSCode.

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to provide support for the SIN language within VSCode, allowing the program to be used as an IDE of sorts.

### Features

Currently, syntax highlighting is the focus of this project. However, there are a number of features that I hope to add with this extension eventually:

* Syntax highlighting
* Integration with the VSCode debug tool
* Linting capabilities
* Support for hovering to view function signatures and documentation

## Getting Started

This code can be packaged using ```vsce``` according to the [Microsoft documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension).

Note Microsoft requires personal access tokens to do this.
