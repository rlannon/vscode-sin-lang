# vscode-sin-lang

A VSCode extension to allow development of the SIN Language within VSCode.

## Goal of the Project

The goal of this project is to provide support for the [SIN programming language](http://github.com/rlannon/SINx86) within VSCode, allowing the program to be used as an IDE of sorts.

### Features

Currently, syntax highlighting is the only working feature of this extension. However, there are a number of features that I hope to add with this extension eventually:

* Integration with the VSCode debug tool
* Linting capabilities
* Support for hovering to view function signatures, documentation, etc.

## Getting Started

This package is currently not available on the VSCode Marketplace. However, it can be packaged using `vsce` according to the [Microsoft documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension). Note that Microsoft requires personal access tokens to do this.
